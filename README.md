# Kinquett Prorgams
Hello, world!

This repo has all of the programs I made for [MusicOnStereo](https://github.com/MusicOnStereo)'s programming language (Kinquett / George) which you can try out for yourself [here](https://github.com/MusicOnStereo/Kinquett).
I hope you enjoy them I guess?

Also, there's really no point in learning Kinquett as you might as well just learn a modern programming language like Python, JavaScript, C / C++/ C#, etc.
